# -The-Secret-Order
In a secret organization, members communicate through a series of symbols. Each symbol represents a specific letter, and the following clues will help you decipher the message:

Symbol A is represented by the letter C.
Symbol D is represented by the letter F.
Symbol G is represented by the letter I.
Symbol J is represented by the letter L.
Symbol M is represented by the letter O.
Symbol P is represented by the letter R.
Symbol S is represented by the letter U.
What letters do symbols B, E, H, K, N, Q, and T represent?

Solution:
Based on the given clues, we can create a symbol-to-letter mapping as follows:

A -> C
D -> F
G -> I
J -> L
M -> O
P -> R
S -> U

Using this mapping, we can determine the corresponding letters for the remaining symbols:

B -> E
E -> H
H -> K
K -> N
N -> Q
Q -> T
T -> W

Therefore, symbols B, E, H, K, N, Q, and T represent the letters E, H, K, N, Q, T, and W, respectively.
